					<h2>Why print with pangaea</h2>
					<div class="spacer-32px"></div>

					<p>
					<b>We didn't set out to be just another print shop.</b> We started
					Pangaea because we knew printing could be smarter, faster, and a
					hell of a lot more fun. After years in the industry, we were
					tired of doing things the old way so we built something better:
					a place focused on people, process, and the thrill of making
					something real.
					</p>
					<p>
					At our shop in West Sacramento, you'll find us surrounded by color
					swatches, test prints, and the steady hum of machines doing their
					thing. We geek out over materials, chase better workflows, and still
					get a little rush when the first perfect print rolls off the press.
					</p>
					<p>
					For us, print is more than the final product — it's the connection
					it creates. Every banner, decal, and sticker we make tells someone's
					story, and we take that seriously. That's what keeps us coming back,
					sleeves rolled, ink-stained, and ready for whatever comes next.
					</p>
